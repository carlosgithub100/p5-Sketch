What was challenging for you during this process? 

For me the most chllenging process at first was figuring out how the 2D shapes worked. It was somewhat difficult to understand what the number coordinates actully meant. I kidn of just learn it through experimentation and testing the number values until I figured what direction or to what length each part of the shape grew due to my number changes. It was also kind of difficult to understand the order of the fill/stroke commands and how it affected what parts of my sketch got affected.
What makes more sense now than it did before you started?

Now the way my sketch's 2d shapesa and line are affected by the fill and stroke command is a lot more clear to me. I'm a lot more comfortable working with the coordinates of the 2d shapes. At first I was sruggling to make my sketch's parts cohesive to make a drawing, but now I feel more confident in my abilities. What are you proud of?
I'm proud of my sketch of Pikachu. There were definitely some difficukties recreating his features but I'm proud it came out looking pretty well in my opinion.
