For me it was challenging to decipher making formuals for my coordinate points so that I could understand the relationship between x,y and h,w. 
It was also difficult to create my shape exactly to my sketch.



Now understanding the coordinate positioning of every shape in my drawing seems to make a little more sense. 
Creating a function for the seamless creation of my shapes was also a little challenging at first, but getting it all down helped with that.



I am most proud of the fact that I was able to overcome my challenges with the first sketch. 
With my first sketch my coordinates were not labelled properly in regard to the other shapes especially with the triangles I was messing up the width and height.
